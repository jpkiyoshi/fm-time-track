## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   TypeScript
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I had some trouble trying to utilize absolute positioning inside a grid container and making it responsive. Also, ran into some difficulties with TypeScript. In the end I was able to accomplish this, but I'm not sure I'm happy with the code I wrote. It's definitely not perfect. For now, it was the best I could do.

### Continued development

I would like to better my grid and TypeScript skills.
